first page there are some messages. after a few seconds a button appears. i used javascript to make the button only appear after 7seconds to make sure the messages are read.

second page there is a preloader because i suck at this so it takes a while for the page to load all the js. there is a randomly selected message, 3 buttons wich for now lead to empty pages.

for the future:

make all other pages same style as main, rainy hearts, background style.

poems and letters add same javascript random selector from an array of letters and poems.

games are fun minigames i found and some love eastereggs c:
